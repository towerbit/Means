# Means SDK Contract v1

This document is the human-readable contract for official Means SDKs. The machine-readable companion is `means-sdk-v1.yaml`; generated SDKs and hand-written SDKs must treat the YAML plus fixtures as the source of truth.

## Endpoint Styles

Means SDKs must support both address styles:

- Path-style: `https://api.means.local/{bucket}/{key}`
- Virtual-hosted-style: `https://{bucket}.means.local/{key}`

The default SDK mode is path-style for local development and virtual-hosted-style for production.

## Authentication

Node and server-side SDKs support SigV4 header signing and query presigning. Browser SDKs must not expose `AccessKey/SecretKey`; browser callers use anonymous access or presigned URLs.

Default scope:

- Algorithm: `AWS4-HMAC-SHA256`
- Service: `s3`
- Region: `us-east-1`
- Payload hash: `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD` for SDK-generated requests
- Presigned URL maximum expiration: `604800` seconds, which is seven days

## Naming Rules

Bucket names use the v1 DNS-compatible subset:

- length is 3 to 63 characters
- lower-case letters, digits, hyphen, and dot only
- first and last characters must be letters or digits
- consecutive dots, dot-hyphen, hyphen-dot, and IPv4-address-shaped names are rejected

Object keys use the v1 storage-safe subset:

- non-empty UTF-8 string
- maximum encoded length is 1,024 bytes
- control characters are rejected

## Operations

All SDKs expose the same logical operations:

- `listBuckets`
- `createBucket`
- `headBucket`
- `deleteBucket`
- `getBucketVersioning`
- `putBucketVersioning`
- `getBucketLifecycle`
- `putBucketLifecycle`
- `deleteBucketLifecycle`
- `listObjects`
- `listObjectVersions`
- `putObject`
- `getObject`
- `headObject`
- `deleteObject`
- `getObjectTagging`
- `putObjectTagging`
- `deleteObjectTagging`
- `copyObject`
- `getBucketCors`
- `putBucketCors`
- `deleteBucketCors`
- `getBucketNotification`
- `putBucketNotification`
- `deleteBucketNotification`
- `initiateMultipartUpload`
- `uploadPart`
- `uploadPartCopy`
- `completeMultipartUpload`
- `abortMultipartUpload`
- `listParts`
- `listMultipartUploads`
- `createPresignedGetUrl`
- `createPresignedPutUrl`
- `createPresignedUploadPartUrl`

Language-specific casing may follow the host language: C# uses PascalCase async methods, TypeScript uses camelCase methods.

The server also implements operations that the v1 SDK surface does not wrap. They are marked `serverOnly: true` in `means-sdk-v1.yaml` and are reachable through any S3 client:

- `listObjectsV1` — `GET /{bucket}` without `list-type`, paginated with `marker`/`NextMarker`
- `deleteObjects` — `POST /{bucket}?delete`, up to 1000 keys per request
- `getBucketLocation` — `GET /{bucket}?location`
- `getBucketAcl`, `putBucketAcl`, `getObjectAcl`, `putObjectAcl` — `?acl`, owner-only canned ACLs

`listObjects` uses `list-type=2` and additionally accepts `start-after`. Both listing generations accept `encoding-type=url`, which URL-encodes keys, prefixes, delimiters, and markers in the response.

## Multipart Upload

SDKs support client-side multipart upload with these constraints:

- `partNumber` is `1..10000`
- non-final parts must be at least `5 MiB`
- SDK high-level helpers default to `16 MiB` parts
- final object ETag is `md5(concat(part-md5-bytes))-part-count`
- incomplete uploads do not appear in normal object listing
- `UploadPartCopy` supports `x-amz-copy-source` and optional `x-amz-copy-source-range`
- `ListParts` exposes `part-number-marker`, `max-parts`, truncation, and next marker fields
- `ListMultipartUploads` exposes `delimiter`, common prefixes, upload markers, and truncation fields

## Versioning and Lifecycle

SDKs expose bucket versioning controls, `ListObjectVersions`, and object operations that preserve the returned `x-amz-version-id` header when present. `GET`, `HEAD`, `DELETE`, object tagging, copy source, and presigned GET support optional `versionId`.

Lifecycle configuration supports these rule actions:

- current object expiration by `Expiration.Days`
- noncurrent version cleanup by `NoncurrentVersionExpiration.NoncurrentDays`
- incomplete multipart cleanup by `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload.DaysAfterInitiation`

## Tagging, CORS, And Notification

SDKs expose object tagging as a key/value map and support optional `versionId` for versioned tags.

Bucket CORS and bucket notification are exposed as raw XML configuration methods in v1. The SDK validates the root element before sending, but it does not attempt to model every AWS XML variant.

## Access Key Policy

Means supports an access-key-scoped IAM-style policy subset in addition to bucket policy.

Evaluation order for signed requests:

1. SigV4 authentication
2. Access-key policy (when `PolicyJson` is present)
3. Bucket policy

Compatibility:

- Access keys without a policy keep the previous authenticated behavior and are only constrained by bucket policy.
- Anonymous requests never evaluate access-key policy.

Access-key policy notes:

- Principal is optional. Missing Principal matches the current access key.
- When Principal is present, it must match `*` or the current access key.
- Deny wins over Allow inside the access-key policy document.
- Service-level actions such as `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` match resource candidates `arn:aws:s3:::*` and `*`.
- Official S3 SDKs do not expose Console access-key management APIs; policy attachment is a server/console concern.

## Error Model

S3 XML errors are mapped into a typed SDK error with:

- `code`
- `message`
- `statusCode`
- `requestId`
- `resource`

SDKs must preserve the original HTTP status and S3-style error code.

## Compression and Range

SDKs do not decompress manually. They preserve response headers and let the runtime transport handle content decoding when applicable.

When a caller sends a Range request, SDKs must not add `Accept-Encoding` for automatic compression. Means serves Range responses from the original uncompressed object representation.

Invalid or unsatisfiable Range requests return `416 InvalidRange` with `Content-Range: bytes */{object-length}`.

## Browser Rules

The browser-safe TypeScript package supports:

- anonymous `GET`, `HEAD`, and `ListObjectsV2` when bucket policy allows it
- `GET` and `PUT` using presigned URLs
- no direct SigV4 signing with secret keys

The Node package supports the full operation set.
